## Frameworks and Libraries

## Editors and Tools

- [The Text Triumvirate](http://www.drbunsen.org/the-text-triumvirate/) <- What I use in class
- [Python 3 http.server](https://docs.python.org/3/library/http.server.html) 
This module contains the Python 3 equivalent of SimpleHTTPServer. The server can be started with `python -m http.server <port>`, after downloading the module (probably with pip).
